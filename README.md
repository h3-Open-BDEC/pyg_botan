# PyG_BOTAN

This code offers [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) (PyG) implementation
of BOnd TArgetting Network (BOTAN, 牡丹), proposed in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14024). By BOTAN, intricate relaxation processes in glassy dynamics can be predicted with high precision from the static particle configuration, by setting neighbor-pair separation with time as its target quantity of learning. From a functional viewpoint, this code can be positioned as a straightfoward extension of the previous [TensorFlow/JAX code](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/glassy_dynamics) provided by Deepmind & Google Brain group, offering a feature of predicting particle propensity as well. 

This is a beta version at present. The major version of PyG_BOTAN, offering a primary functions of simultaneous learning of relative motions (edge feature) and particle self-motion (node feature), will be released at an appropriate moment after the review process of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14024) progressed. Please [e-mail us](mailto:shiba@cc.u-tokyo.ac.jp) if you want use the provisional version of the code or the full part of our dataset. 

## Dataset
A small dataset for run test is attached in the directory named ``small_data`` in this repo. 

Our full dataset will be made open when our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14024) is accepted for formal publication. 


## How to use 
- Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) (>=1.11.0) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) (>=2.0.4)  
Please refer to respective websites for installation.  PyTorch Geometric requires the three following packages, ``torch-geometric, torch-sparse, torch-scatter``, which take a certain lapse of time (typically a few minutes) for installtion.  
Make sure these packages are installed on the same CUDA (or ROCm) version. 

- Edit ``run.py`` to specify ``temperature`` (0.44 by default) and ``time_index`` (7 by deafult).  
- ``time_index`` indicates the time point, see [Supplemental Information](https://arxiv.org/src/2206.14024v1/anc/suppl.pdf) of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14024).   
``time_index=7`` corresponds to  the alpha-relaxation time.  
- When ``if_train_edge=True``, pair-distance changes are learnt on the edges of the network, otherwise, particle propensity is learnt on its nodes. 
- Run the code  
```python3 run.py```


## Data format
Our dataset contains results of isoconfigurational ensembles of simulation results for 3D Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones liquid, generated from 500 independent initial configurations. Each isoconfigurational ensemble consists of 32 separate molecular trajectories generated with different initial velocities. Although this dataset has some features in common with that by V. Bapst et al, our dataset is independently generated by keeping the box length constant  at $L=15.05658$ all through and for all the temperatures. 

The data is stored in a uncompressed ``.npz`` binary format. Each ``.npz`` file contains three list of arrays with keys indicated below:

- `types`  
the particle types (0 == type A and 1 == type B) of the equilibrated system.
- `initial_positions`  
the particle positions of the equilibrated system.
- `positions`:   
the positions of the particles for each of the trajectories at selected time point.  Note that the shape of this numpy array is (32,4096,3), which means that particle positions of 32 isoconfigurational ensembles are stored with 4096 particles in three spatial dimensions. 

All units are in the nondimensional Lennard-Jones units.  Note that the positions are stored in the absolute coordinate system, so they can be out of the simulation box if the particle goes beyond the periodic boundary.
